1) Set up subscription process and gateway. 
2) Set up email sending engine (this is an automated task that gets all the active subscriptions and sends an entry if required and runs every 15 minutes). 
3) Configure and format the email so it uses a custom font and has some amount of design to it.
4) Migrate the whole project to the server!

I also need to resolve the issue with the credit card. I don't know what to do. The bank is virtually non-responsive and Mailgun doesn't show much interest in allowing me to pay with PayPal. We can still use the service to configure the system but can only send to 5 verified emails (you didn't verify your email address, BTW).
